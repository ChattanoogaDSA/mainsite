There is a rumor going around that we use the 'S' word. It's true. We are _socialists_. We believe in a government that works for everybody. There is another word in our name: _democratic_. Chattanoogans are a diverse set and we are not always going to agree. We believe in the power of democracy to hold our leaders accountable and to make sure everyone's voices are heard.

\[A\] socialist society represents an advance to a higher stage of life—that is, a form of society which is economically, socially, culturally, and ethically superior to a system based upon production for private profit. History shows that the processes of social change have nothing in common with silly notions about "plots" and "conspiracies." The development of human society—from tribalism to feudalism, to capitalism, to socialism-is brought about by the needs and aspirations of mankind for a better life.

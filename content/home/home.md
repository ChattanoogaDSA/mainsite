# Who We Are

The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is the largest socialist organization in the United States with over 70,000 members nationally.

**At the root of our socialism is a profound commitment to democracy, as means and end.** DSA members in our chapter and across the country fight for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.

We want a better, more socialist future for all. Here are some of systemic changes we’re working toward:

* Medicare for All
* Abolishing ICE
* Prison abolition
* Defunding the police and investing in our communities
* A Green New Deal and Climate Justice
* Cancelling student debt
* Workplace protections and strong unions
* Electing democratic socialists to local, state and national government

**The members in our chapter believe that democratic socialism will gain support in Chattanooga.** We want to connect and support the fights for equality and justice already underway here — and add our own perspective where it’s welcome.

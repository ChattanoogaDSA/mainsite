## Who We Are

The [Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)](https://www.dsausa.org/ "DSA National") is the largest socialist organization in the United States with over 70,000 members nationally. We believe that **working people should run both the economy and society democratically to meet human needs**, not to make profits for a few. 

**At the root of our socialism is a profound commitment to democracy, as means and end.** DSA members in our chapter and across the country fight for reforms that increase the power of working people and weaken the power of corporations. We are a political and activist organization, not a party. Through campus and community-based chapters, DSA members use a variety of tactics, from legislative to direct action, to fight for reforms that empower working people.

We want a better, more socialist future for all. Here are some of systemic changes we’re working toward:

* Medicare for All
* Abolishing ICE
* Prison abolition
* Defunding the police and investing in our communities
* A Green New Deal and Climate Justice
* Cancelling student debt
* Workplace protections and strong unions
* Electing democratic socialists to local, state and national government

**The members in our chapter believe that democratic socialism will gain support in Chattanooga.** We want to connect and support the fights for equality and justice already underway here — and add our own Chattanooga twist.

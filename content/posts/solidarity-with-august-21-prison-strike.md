We, the Chattanooga Democratic Socialists of America and the Young Democratic Socialists of America of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, have voted to endorse the upcoming prison strike which incarcerated people across the country have declared and which will be taking place this summer from August 21st to September 9th.

The demands of the prisoners can be found [here: http://sawarimi.org/national-prison-strike](http://sawarimi.org/national-prison-strike)

Tennessee is the epicenter of some of the most egregious intersections of capitalist exploitation and mass incarceration. CoreCivic began as the Corrections Corporation of America in Nashville and is now the second largest private prison operator in the United States of America. One of the first private prisons operated by CoreCivic, Silverdale Detention Center in Chattanooga, has been under contract with Hamilton County since 1984, with discussions for a 100 year contract.

The abuses of the private prison system include lack of medical care, lack of adequate food, and abuse. Silverdale Detention Center has a history of abuse including the death of a baby due to the mishandling of an incarcerated personâ€™s pregnancy in 2010, and a long history of physical and mental abuse of inmates.

We fully support the prisoners in their struggle for their rights.

In solidarity,  
The Chattanooga Democratic Socialists of America  
The Young Democratic Socialists of America of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga

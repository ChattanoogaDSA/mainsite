### What is DSA?

The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is the largest socialist organization in the United States. DSA's members are building progressive movements for social change while establishing an openly democratic socialist presence in American communities and politics. DSA fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.

### Why Chattanooga?

Our members are Chattanoogans who believe that democratic socialism will gain support in Chattanooga. We want to connect and support the fights for equality and justice already underway in Chattanooga. We want to add our own perspective where it's welcome.

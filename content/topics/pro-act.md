# PRO Act

Our chapter is committed to working with \[National DSA\]([https://pro-act.dsausa.org/](https://pro-act.dsausa.org/ "PRO Act page of National DSA")) to get the PRO Act passed!. 

In June 2021 we held a public Q&A for anyone interested to learn about the key issues solved by the PRO Act and next steps to getting it passed. 

Here is the recording of that session:

#### Help us pass the PRO Act!

We need help spreading the word and making it easier to organize in the workplace. For too long the odds have been stacked against the average worker who wants to bargain collectively. 

To get involved or just to see what we're up to, you can [follow our activity in Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/noogadsa/shared_invite/zt-dc30et8n-Y8dNgPEH\~TM5hcd4XV7olQ "slack invite"). You do not have to be a member of our chapter to participate in our Slack.

## We're so glad you want to join us!

DSA is funded and run by it’s dues-paying members to ensure that it remains accountable only to us. By becoming a dues-paying member, you are gaining voting rights in Chattanooga DSA and financially supporting the fight for democratic control of the economy and political system for the good of all people, rather than a wealthy few, in Chattanooga and across the country. A portion of your dues go to our local chapter when you [sign up for national membership](https://act.dsausa.org/donate/membership_redesign/ "sign up for national membership"). 

You can also [donate directly to Chattanooga DSA](/dues-and-donations "Chattanooga DSA donation page") to support our chapter’s efforts.

**No one will ever be turned away due to lack of funds.** Apply for a [dues waiver](https://dsausa.org/dueswaiver "dues waiver") if you are unable to pay for national dues at this time.

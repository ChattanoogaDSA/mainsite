# Who We Are

We are the Chattanooga chapter of the [Democratic Socialists of America](https://www.dsausa.org/ "Democratic Socialists of America"), the largest socialist organization in the United States. We believe that **working people should run both the economy and society democratically to meet human needs**, not to make profits for a few. We are a political and activist organization, not a party; through campus and community-based chapters, DSA members use a variety of tactics, from legislative to direct action, to fight for reforms that empower working people.

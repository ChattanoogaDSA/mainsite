# Our work

Chattanooga DSA supports the national DSA efforts to fight for the rights of all, including the woefully underserved: workers, women, BIPOC, LGTBQIA, immigrants, disabled, and the environment. Here are some examples of our most recent focus areas and campaigns.

## Defund the police

The Chattanooga Police Department (CPD) commands $70 Million of the total city budget of $259 Million (27%) . Chattanooga DSA believes that a portion of these funds should be reallocated to better serve our community. To that end, Chattanooga DSA has proposed several amendments to the current city budget that diverts over $4.5 Million from the inflated CPD budget and reappropriates this amount to:

* Affordable Housing Fund
* Head Start
* Human Services Administration (for day care services)
* Chattanooga Public Library
* Impending skatepark (city funded)
* Chattanooga Area Food Bank.

## Tenant Rights

The COVID-19 health crisis has laid bare the unequal treatment of tenants both in our society as a whole and Chattanooga specifically. As a result, Chattanooga DSA calls for the suspension of residential and commercial rents, property taxes, and mortgages as well as a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures. Additionally, no essential services should be shut off during this pandemic. Chattanooga DSA is working locally with community partners to advocate for tenants currently facing evictions.

## Affordable Housing

Chattanooga DSA firmly believes that affordable housing is a human right and personal wealth should not be an impediment to quality, safe housing. We are hopeful for the day when public housing in the United States mirrors that seen in European countries such as Finland, Austria, and Belgium, to name a few. Chattanooga DSA has submitted an amendment proposal to the city council to divest $1,000,000 from the Police Department and to reinvest these funds in the existing Affordable Housing Fund capital project

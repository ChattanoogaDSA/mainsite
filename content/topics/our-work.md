# Our work

Chattanooga DSA supports the national DSA efforts to fight for the rights of all, including the woefully underserved: workers, women, BIPOC, LGTBQIA, undocumented Americans, people with disabilities, and the environment. We are working locally on the following platforms.

## Defund the Police

The Chattanooga Police Department (CPD) commands $70 Million of the total city budget of $259 Million (27%). We believe that a portion of these funds should be reallocated to better serve our community. To that end, we have proposed several amendments to the current city budget that diverts over $4.5 Million from the inflated CPD budget and reappropriates this amount to:

* Affordable Housing Fund
* Head Start
* Human Services Administration (day care services)
* Chattanooga Public Library
* Impending skatepark (city funded
* Chattanooga Area Food Bank

In addition to these amendments, we have been intimately involved in the local Black Lives Matter protests, serving as marshals and coordinating supplies with local partners like Concerned Citizens for Justice and icantbreathcha.

## Tenant Rights

The COVID-19 health crisis has laid bare the unequal treatment of tenants both in our society as a whole and Chattanooga specifically. As a result, we call for the suspension of residential and commercial rents, property taxes, and mortgages as well as a moratorium on evictions and foreclosures. Additionally, no essential services should be shut off during this pandemic. We are working locally with community partners to advocate for tenants currently facing evictions.

## Affordable Housing

We firmly believe that affordable housing is a human right and personal wealth should not be an impediment to quality, safe housing. We are hopeful for the day when public housing in the United States mirrors that seen in European countries such as Finland, Austria, and Belgium, to name a few. We have submitted an amendment proposal to the city council to divest $1,000,000 from the Police Department and to reinvest these funds in the existing Affordable Housing Fund capital project.

## COVID-19 Respone & Mutual Aid

The coronavirus pandemic has laid bare like never before the inherent cruelty of America’s capitalist economic system. Millions across this country are losing their jobs and unable to pay their rent, unable to buy food, losing their employer-sponsored health insurance, and risking their lives as essential workers in unsafe conditions - all because if we just took care of people’s needs, some billionaire wouldn’t get to profit off of that.

[We have demanded that our leaders at all levels take action.](https://www.google.com/search?q=change.org+chattanooga+dsa&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS827US827&oq=change.org+chattanooga+dsa&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60j69i61.3183j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 "change.org petitions") But until our cries stop falling on deaf ears, we have to form our own networks, and we’ve been doing mutual aid work since this pandemic started.

## Bernie 2020

The Democratic Socialists of America endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic primary campaign, and we proudly ran an IEC here in Chattanooga to that end. We knocked doors and made calls for Bernie all over Chattanooga from October to March, spread the word about DSA, and formed new relationships with people in our community.  

[Bernie’s platform](https://berniesanders.com/issues/) is absolutely transformative for millions of Americans and will guide us as we develop our voter guides and candidate endorsement criteria for local, state and federal elections in 2020 and beyond.

In analyzing the situation here in Chattanooga, TN, we have found that there is
**a lack of institutional power that is answerable to the broader population**, and
most power is wrapped up in and around a few groups of wealthy people.

To build up people power, Chattanooga DSA has decided to **focus on mutual aid
actions** aiming to find a place where we can build community power parallel to
the current power structure.

### Previous Actions

#### DSA Taillight Clinic

Because a broken taillight can be a derailing life event when a person is pulled
over by the police and lacks the means to deal with the issue, we went to a
gentrifying, targeted neighborhood and offered to replace taillights for free
for the community. This action was inspired by the New Orleans DSA chapter.

## Socialist Night School

##### April 1st, 2021

We are discussing some core topics on what socialism is and what it isn't. The discussion will take place in small groups and then carry over into a large group discussion. We will keep the conversation very approachable and practical. The goal is to lock down the core principles and grow together.The readings are rewarding, but dense. We will provide a high-level summary before diving into the discussion in case you don't have the time to read every word.

[**Communist Manifesto, Chapter 1**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WfYU9Aa8SIPZom3yzC-c7PpD_wLe0W7E/view) - Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels (1848) - 13 pages, 40 min read

> This is perhaps the most foundational text of the socialist movement. The first chapter covers the expansion of capital and the consolidation of the bourgeoisie as a class, as well as their relationship to the proletariat and their role in history.

[**Understanding Capitalism (excerpt**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CTxMynZZYMrtbf30mR8o23vWUQCBFYOh/view)**)** - Vivek Chibber (2018) - 13 pages, 40 min read

> In this excerpt from his three-part ABCs of Capitalism, Chibber lays out the fundamental economic mechanics that structure capitalism, particularly as they contrast with previous modes of economic organization. Understanding these dynamics are essential for socialists. Capitalism is not exploitative because capitalists are bad people (although many are), but because the mechanics of the system push the choices of capitalists and workers alike into certain channels based on their material interests. Understanding these pressures allows us to make informed and strategic interventions to shift them in the direction of socialism.

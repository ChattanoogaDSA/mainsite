## Poor People's Campaign

Beth Foster, co-director of the [Mercy Junction Justice and Peace Center](mercyjunction.org),
will come and present on the [Poor People's Campaign](https://poorpeoplescampaign.org/).

The Poor People’s Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival is uniting tens
of thousands of people across the country to challenge the evils of systemic
racism, poverty, the war economy, ecological devastation and the nation’s distorted
morality. We need you to step up and join our efforts.

## Officer Elections

We will have officer elections, for the positions set forth in our bylaws: Chair,
Vice-chair, Secretary, and Treasurer.

If you want to know more about officer elections, please ask in the Facebook
group.
